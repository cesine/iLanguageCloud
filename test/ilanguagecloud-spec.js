  ======== A Handy Little Jasmine Reference ========
https://github.com/pivotal/jasmine/wiki/Matchers

  Spec matchers:
    expect(x).toEqual(y); compares objects or primitives x and y and passes if they are equivalent
    expect(x).toBe(y); compares objects or primitives x and y and passes if they are the same object
    expect(x).toMatch(pattern); compares x to string or regular expression pattern and passes if they match
    expect(x).toBeDefined(); passes if x is not undefined
    expect(x).toBeUndefined(); passes if x is undefined
    expect(x).toBeNull(); passes if x is null
    expect(x).toBeTruthy(); passes if x evaluates to true
    expect(x).toBeFalsy(); passes if x evaluates to false
    expect(x).toContain(y); passes if array or string x contains y
    expect(x).toBeLessThan(y); passes if x is less than y
    expect(x).toBeGreaterThan(y); passes if x is greater than y
    expect(function(){fn();}).toThrow(e); passes if function fn throws exception e when executed

    Every matcher's criteria can be inverted by prepending .not:
    expect(x).not.toEqual(y); compares objects or primitives x and y and passes if they are not equivalent

    Custom matchers help to document the intent of your specs, and can help to remove code duplication in your specs.
